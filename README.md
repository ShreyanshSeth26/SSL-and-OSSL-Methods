# Model Implementations Overview

This repository contains model implementations covering three different modalities:

- **Text**: Implemented with a focus on the PubMed-RCT dataset.
- **Image**: Demonstrated using the CIFAR-100 dataset.
- **Audio**: Implemented on the ESC-50 dataset.

Each model has its own dedicated folder containing three Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files that detail the steps from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference.
